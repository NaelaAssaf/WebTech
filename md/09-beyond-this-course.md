# Beyond this course

As you can imagine, there is more to be learned about Web Technologies then we are able to cover during this course.

## JavaScript

Modern web applications make heavy use of JavaScript to obtain high user
interactivity. This course skipped the user side interactivity via JavaScript
because in order to create a JavaScript application you need to know about HTML
and CSS for the frontend and a serverside language to create the backend.
Although JavaScript (nodejs) is used more and more as the serverside backend,
PHP is still the more broadly used language...

## CSS frameworks

It can become quite cumbersome to (re)create base styles from scratch. This is
an issue many developers run into and for this purpose CSS frameworks where
created. These frameworks ensure an identifiable style uniform across browsers.
They also aid in responsive design etc...

Some popular choices:

### [(Twitter) Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites with Bootstrap, the
world’s most popular front-end open source toolkit, featuring Sass variables
and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful
JavaScript plugins.

### [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your
markup.

Bulma: the modern CSS framework that just works.
</p>

Bulma is a free, open source framework that provides ready-to-use frontend
components that you can easily combine to build responsive web interfaces.


## PHP frameworks

Many PHP applications also share common functionality: user authentication, receiving, sanitizing and processing data etc.

To prevent developers of reinventing the wheel over and over again, PHP frameworks where created.

### [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)

### [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)

repetitive coding tasks and enjoy the power of controlling your code.
