# Getting started

This course requires some software to be installed.

* A web browser: [firefox](https://firefox.com)
* A text editor: [gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit)
* [PHP](http://www.php.net)
* [GIT](https://www.git-scm.com)

Normally these packages are already installed on the provided VM. If not, they
can easily be installed by running:

```bash
sudo dnf install firefox gedit php git
```

Press `y` when prompted `Is this ok [y/N]:`{.text-muted}.
