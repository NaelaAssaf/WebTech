# Getting started

In order to follow this course, some software is required:

* A web browser: [firefox](https://firefox.com)
* A text editor: gedit
* [PHP](http://www.php.net)
* [GIT](https://www.git-scm.com)

Normally these packages are already installed on the provided VM. If not, they
can easily be installed by running:

```bash
sudo dnf install firefox gedit php git
```
